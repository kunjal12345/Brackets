    <h3>I Love To Sketch</h3>
    <p>A sketch is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a number of purposes , it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle.Through Sketching/Drawing We Can Express Our Emotions .</p>
    <p>Sketches can be made in any drawing medium. The term is most often applied to graphic work executed in a dry medium such as silverpoint, graphite, pencil, charcoal or pastel. It may also apply to drawings executed in pen and ink, digital input such as a digital pen, ballpoint pen, marker pen, water colour and oil paint. The latter two are generally referred to as "water colour sketches" and "oil sketches". A sculptor might model three-dimensional sketches in clay, plasticine or wax.</p>
